##Jazzzz-Jazz music creator.

The project is all about bringing music and technology together bringing my love for both the worlds together.
The motive of this project is to enhance everyday life, amplify your mood the way you feel using music as the language and AI as the tool.

This project creates random jazz music using different instruments implemented in the programming language Chuck, using pre-generated chords that I know. 
This project is quite rudimentary and needs more time from my side, i used chuck because i wanted to learn a new programming but not in the traditional sense and Chuck gave me just that allowed me to convert my musical prowess to technical one. 
There were quite a few steps, first was learning the language and then thinking about an interesting project which would keep me engaged and internet helped me figure out 

Just download the chuck programming language and change the directories in the project for the audio files and the project should run smoothly. 
Use the Random_Jazz_Generator_Master.ck as the master controller for the project.

If anybody wants to give me any jazzier ideas, i would love to learn.
